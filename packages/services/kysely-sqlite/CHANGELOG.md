### Patch Changes

- 7406bfe: Rename the agent runtime from `AI*` to `Agent*` (#596)

  `AI` described the model provider, not the thing being named. Every symbol that
  belongs to the agent runtime now says `Agent`; the symbols that genuinely wrap a
  model provider — `AIEmbeddingService`, `AIProviderOptions`, `AIEmbedParams`,
  `AITranscriptionParams`, `AIGenerateImageParams` and their siblings, and the
  `@pikku/ai-vercel` / `@pikku/ai-deepinfra` / `@pikku/ai-voice` packages — keep
  their names.

  **Wiring**
  - `pikkuAIAgent` → `pikkuAgent`, `pikkuAIScorer` → `pikkuAgentScorer`,
    `pikkuAIJudge` → `pikkuAgentJudge`
  - `CoreAIAgent` → `CoreAgent`, `AIAgentInput` → `AgentInput`, `AIAgentStep` →
    `AgentStep`, `AIMessage` → `AgentMessage`, and the rest of the agent types
  - `AIAgentRunnerService` → `AgentRunnerService`, `AIStorageService` →
    `AgentStorageService`, `AIRunStateService` → `AgentRunStateService`

  **Entry points**

  `@pikku/core/agent` → `@pikku/core/agent`, `@pikku/core/agent-scorer` →
  `@pikku/core/agent-scorer`.

  **Queues**

  The scorer queues are now `agent-score-fast` and `agent-score-slow`. Drain the
  old `ai-score-fast` / `ai-score-slow` queues before deploying — jobs still
  sitting on them when the new workers start will never be picked up.

  **Scaffolds**

  The agent scaffold pikku wrote for your project — `<scaffold>/agent/agent.gen.ts`
  and its schemas file — imports `@pikku/core/ai-agent`, which no longer exists. A
  scaffold is normally written once and then left alone, so `pikku all` would find
  it present and leave the broken import in place. It now deletes an agent scaffold
  importing either removed entry point and regenerates it in the same run. Anything
  you added to that file goes with it, so move local edits out first.

  **Database**

  The agent tables are renamed: `ai_threads`, `ai_message`, `ai_tool_call`,
  `ai_working_memory`, `ai_run` and `ai_run_score` become `agent_threads`,
  `agent_message`, `agent_tool_call`, `agent_working_memory`, `agent_run` and
  `agent_run_score`, along with their indexes and the `ai_working_memory_pk`
  constraint. The same rename applies to the MongoDB collections.

  `ensurePikkuSchema` creates tables it cannot find, so an existing database will
  get empty `agent_*` tables and leave the old data stranded in `ai_*`. Rename
  them before the first boot on the new version:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE ai_threads        RENAME TO agent_threads;
  ALTER TABLE ai_message        RENAME TO agent_message;
  ALTER TABLE ai_tool_call      RENAME TO agent_tool_call;
  ALTER TABLE ai_working_memory RENAME TO agent_working_memory;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run            RENAME TO agent_run;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run_score      RENAME TO agent_run_score;
  ```

- 6794681: Publish the ecosystem surface as per-area sub-barrels under `@pikku/core/ecosystem/*`, and point generated code, the CLI, the inspector and the runtime adapters at them.

  348 names that only generated code, the toolchain or a runtime adapter ever imports now have a second home on `@pikku/core/ecosystem/<area>` — one sub-barrel per area, matching how core already publishes its entrypoints, so no single barrel grows without bound and a consumer only pulls in the area it uses.

  This step is additive: every name is still exported from the entrypoint it was published from before, so nothing downstream breaks. Removing them from the app-facing barrels is a later change, and needs a release carrying `./ecosystem/*` first.

### Patch Changes

- fd9d834: Stop publishing internals that only their own package or file used. The declarations stay; only the entrypoint re-export is removed, so nothing that imported a name from where it is declared is affected.

## 0.12.10

### Patch Changes

- 9d62571: Make user-defined SQL functions an explicit, checked capability of the SQLite drivers.

  `node:sqlite` can register scalar UDFs (`db.function()`); `bun:sqlite` cannot. Until now
  neither driver mentioned that, so an app that registered a UDF by reaching for the raw
  connection worked on Node and, on bun, failed as `no such function: …` from whichever
  query used it — typically one endpoint breaking in production while everything else
  looked healthy.

  Both drivers now export `registerSqliteFunctions(db, functions)` and accept a
  `functions` option on `createNodeSqliteKysely` / `createBunSqliteKysely`. The Node
  implementation registers them as deterministic; the bun implementation throws
  `SqliteFunctionsUnsupportedError` — exported from `@pikku/kysely-sqlite`, and naming
  every function requested — so the incompatibility surfaces at wiring time with a message
  saying what to do about it.

## 0.12.9

### Patch Changes

- c335f73: `LibsqlWebDialect` now encodes a `Date` bind parameter as an ISO-8601 string and an array or plain record as JSON, instead of throwing `libsql: unsupported argument type object`.

  This closes a dev/prod split that broke every write in a deployed libsql app. The CLI's `node:sqlite` dev runtime already coerced dates and objects before binding them, so a query that stamps a `createdAt` or writes a JSON column passed under `pikku dev` — and then threw on the same code path once the app was deployed to a Worker, where this dialect is the one in use. Reads were unaffected, so the symptom was an app whose every insert and update failed while every list and get worked.

  Both runtimes also stop accepting objects JSON cannot faithfully represent. A `Map`, a `RegExp` or a class instance stringifies to `"{}"` or to a partial view of itself, so binding one used to persist an empty JSON blob where the caller meant something; it now throws. Only arrays and plain records (including null-prototype ones) are JSON-encoded. The two coercions are deliberately identical — a value that binds under `pikku dev` binds the same way once deployed, which is the property whose absence caused the original bug.

  Unsupported values now name their constructor — `unsupported argument type Map` rather than `unsupported argument type object`.

## 0.12.8

### Patch Changes

- 66f3dae: Move `@pikku/core` from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` in the last packages that still declared it as a regular dependency.

  `@pikku/core` holds a single `pikkuState` registry and must resolve to exactly one copy at runtime — every wiring (workflows, RPCs, queue workers, middleware) registers into the copy it imports, and the runner reads the copy it imports. 35 packages already declare core as a peer for this reason; these six were the stragglers. Because they carried a regular `@pikku/core` dependency, bumping any one of them could leave a second, older core locked in a consumer's tree, splitting the registry so wirings silently fail to resolve (surfaced as `[PKU717] Multiple @pikku/core versions installed`).

  Making core a peer everywhere means the consuming app provides the one copy (the react/react-dom singleton pattern), so duplication is structurally impossible. `@pikku/core` is also kept as a devDependency in each package so it still builds/typechecks standalone.

  Backward-compatible for consumers that already list `@pikku/core` directly (every template does). A consumer that only pulled core transitively now gets a loud install-time peer warning instead of a silent runtime split — strictly better.

### Patch Changes

- 41ce2cb: Upgrade to TypeScript 6 and raise the minimum Node.js version to 22.

  All packages now build against `typescript@^6.0.3` and declare `engines.node >= 22`. Internal tooling (`ts-json-schema-generator`, `zod-to-ts`) was bumped to TypeScript 6-compatible releases.

## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 34f254e: Bump the `kysely` dependency range to `^0.29.0` so it dedupes onto a single
  copy alongside Better Auth (which bundles kysely 0.29.x), avoiding two
  incompatible `Kysely` classes (the `#private` brand mismatch) when both pikku's
  adapters and Better Auth share a database connection.

  kysely 0.29 is ESM-only, which the unmaintained `kysely-plugin-serialize`
  (no `exports` map, CommonJS build) cannot import. Its `SerializePlugin` is now
  maintained directly in `@pikku/kysely` and re-exported, and the external
  dependency is dropped from `@pikku/kysely`, `@pikku/kysely-sqlite`, and
  `@pikku/cloudflare`.
