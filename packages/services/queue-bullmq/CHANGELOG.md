## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- e3d4454: Add job groups, so one shared queue can stay fair without splitting into one
  queue per producer.

  A job may now carry `group: { id, tier }`, and a worker may cap how many jobs
  of any one group run at once via `groupConcurrency`. On pg-boss this maps to
  `localGroupConcurrency`, which excludes at-capacity groups from the fetch query
  itself, so a capped group costs nothing rather than being fetched and restored.
  BullMQ declares it unsupported (groups are a BullMQ Pro feature) — being
  push-based, it can simply use a queue per group at no polling cost.

  Workflow services accept a `queueStrategy`. The default `'per-workflow'` is
  unchanged: every workflow gets its own `wf-orchestrator-*` / `wf-step-*` queue,
  which is also what lets serverless providers deploy one unit per workflow. The
  new `'shared-groups'` routes every workflow through the shared
  orchestrator/step-worker queues and isolates them by group instead, so a
  monolith runs one set of pollers rather than one per workflow — on a
  pull-based backend with dozens of workflows that is the difference between
  hundreds of poll loops and twenty. It is for single-process runtimes only; a
  per-unit serverless deploy still needs the per-workflow queues to route to its
  units.

### Patch Changes

- 41ce2cb: Upgrade to TypeScript 6 and raise the minimum Node.js version to 22.

  All packages now build against `typescript@^6.0.3` and declare `engines.node >= 22`. Internal tooling (`ts-json-schema-generator`, `zod-to-ts`) was bumped to TypeScript 6-compatible releases.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- 92cd5b1: feat(workflow): workflow-owned step retries + stable invocationId

  The workflow — not the queue — now owns step retry policy, and each step
  invocation gets a stable idempotency key.
  - **Default `retries: 5` with exponential backoff.** A step with no `retries`
    previously inherited the queue's bare default (e.g. pg-boss `retry_limit 2`,
    no backoff) so retries fired instantly and couldn't outlast a transient
    outage. Retries now default to 5 with backoff, resolved at the workflow layer.
  - **`retries: 0` is honored.** Dispatch previously passed `undefined` options
    for `retries: 0`, letting the queue re-run a non-idempotent step up to its own
    default. The resolved policy now always sets `attempts` (`retries: 0` →
    `attempts: 1`), so the queue never second-guesses the workflow. The persisted
    step retries and the dispatched `attempts` are resolved together so
    "retries exhausted" and "no more redeliveries" are the same event.
  - **`workflowStep.invocationId`** — a deterministic, dependency-free
    `uuidv5(runId:stepName)` handed to every step. Unlike `stepId` (minted per
    attempt), it is identical across retries, so a step can dedupe on it
    (`ON CONFLICT (invocationId)`, Stripe idempotency keys, etc.).
  - **queue-bullmq**: `mapPikkuJobToBull` now maps `backoff` (previously dropped,
    so a step's backoff silently never applied on Redis), and `registerQueues`
    throws a clear error when no logger is available (matching queue-pg-boss).
  - **Dispatch failures are recoverable, not fatal.** A step is now marked
    `scheduled` only _after_ it is successfully handed to its transport (queue or
    scheduler) — a failed hand-off leaves it `pending` so a replay re-dispatches
    it, instead of stranding it in `scheduled` (replay would pause forever on a
    job that was never enqueued). A transport outage (e.g. pg-boss momentarily
    down) is surfaced as a new `WorkflowDispatchException`, which the orchestrator
    treats as transient: the run is left running and the orchestrator job is
    rethrown for redelivery (it replays idempotently from the snapshot) rather
    than the whole run being marked `failed`. The orchestrator job now also
    carries its own retry policy, so this holds even when the orchestrator queue
    is configured `retry_limit 0`. A genuine step error still fails the run.
  - **Same step name can be invoked multiple times in one run.** Step rows are now
    keyed per _invocation_: the Nth reach of a step name in a replay resolves to a
    physical key (`name` for the first, `name#N` for repeats), so a literal
    duplicate name no longer clobbers the earlier step's state. The first reach
    keeps the bare name, so existing rows, graph-node matching and `invocationId`s
    are unchanged. Ordinals are derived deterministically from DSL execution order
    and reset each replay.
  - **Step provenance (`fromStepName`) + graph cycles.** Every step now records
    the predecessor it was scheduled from (`fromStepName`; entry steps have none),
    persisted on the step row across all stores (in-memory, kysely, redis,
    mongodb, cloudflare DO) and carried in the queued payload. The DSL wire
    exposes the derived `fromInvocationId` (`uuidv5(runId:fromStepName)`) so
    consumers get the stable predecessor key without a second persisted id —
    `fromStepName` is the source of truth (it is replay-deterministic; `stepId`,
    minted per row, is not). This makes the walked path reconstructable even when
    a node is reached more than once: in `a → b → a → c` the second `a` is a
    distinct ordinal instance (`a#1`) whose `fromStepName` is `b`.
    The graph runner now supports **cycles**: a forward edge into an
    already-started node still collapses to a single run (joins/diamonds are
    unchanged), but a _back-edge_ — one whose target can reach its source — fires
    a fresh ordinal instance, so a node can loop back to itself. Termination is
    the graph's responsibility (branch routing must converge); the engine enforces
    no visit cap.
