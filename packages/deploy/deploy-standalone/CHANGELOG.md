### Patch Changes

- 32616af: Give the deploy pipeline one shared contract instead of a copy per adapter

  `DeploymentManifest`, `DeploymentUnit`, `EntryGenerationContext` and
  `ProviderAdapter` were hand-copied into eleven source files across the four
  provider adapters and the CLI — three copies inside `@pikku/deploy-cloudflare`
  alone. Nothing compared the copies, so they had already drifted: several typed
  `role` as a bare `string`, and none carried the manifest's addon-scoping fields.

  They now live in a new zero-dependency `@pikku/deploy` package that every
  adapter and the CLI import, and each adapter declares `implements
ProviderAdapter` so the compiler checks it against the contract it claims to
  satisfy. That check immediately caught a real disagreement: the deploy result's
  `workersDeployed` and `resourcesCreated` were `string[]` from Cloudflare — the
  shape the result file and the generated SDK types already record — but
  `Array<{ name: string }>` from the standalone adapter. Both are now `string[]`.

  The Lambda and Azure adapters also derived their esbuild externals from a
  hand-written list of 25 node builtins, so anything outside it (`async_hooks`,
  `perf_hooks`, `timers`, `http2`, …) was bundled instead of resolved from the
  runtime. They now use `nodeBuiltinExternals()`, which reads `builtinModules`
  from the running Node and cannot fall behind it.

## 0.12.11

### Patch Changes

- 7406bfe: Rename the agent runtime from `AI*` to `Agent*` (#596)

  `AI` described the model provider, not the thing being named. Every symbol that
  belongs to the agent runtime now says `Agent`; the symbols that genuinely wrap a
  model provider — `AIEmbeddingService`, `AIProviderOptions`, `AIEmbedParams`,
  `AITranscriptionParams`, `AIGenerateImageParams` and their siblings, and the
  `@pikku/ai-vercel` / `@pikku/ai-deepinfra` / `@pikku/ai-voice` packages — keep
  their names.

  **Wiring**
  - `pikkuAIAgent` → `pikkuAgent`, `pikkuAIScorer` → `pikkuAgentScorer`,
    `pikkuAIJudge` → `pikkuAgentJudge`
  - `CoreAIAgent` → `CoreAgent`, `AIAgentInput` → `AgentInput`, `AIAgentStep` →
    `AgentStep`, `AIMessage` → `AgentMessage`, and the rest of the agent types
  - `AIAgentRunnerService` → `AgentRunnerService`, `AIStorageService` →
    `AgentStorageService`, `AIRunStateService` → `AgentRunStateService`

  **Entry points**

  `@pikku/core/agent` → `@pikku/core/agent`, `@pikku/core/agent-scorer` →
  `@pikku/core/agent-scorer`.

  **Queues**

  The scorer queues are now `agent-score-fast` and `agent-score-slow`. Drain the
  old `ai-score-fast` / `ai-score-slow` queues before deploying — jobs still
  sitting on them when the new workers start will never be picked up.

  **Scaffolds**

  The agent scaffold pikku wrote for your project — `<scaffold>/agent/agent.gen.ts`
  and its schemas file — imports `@pikku/core/ai-agent`, which no longer exists. A
  scaffold is normally written once and then left alone, so `pikku all` would find
  it present and leave the broken import in place. It now deletes an agent scaffold
  importing either removed entry point and regenerates it in the same run. Anything
  you added to that file goes with it, so move local edits out first.

  **Database**

  The agent tables are renamed: `ai_threads`, `ai_message`, `ai_tool_call`,
  `ai_working_memory`, `ai_run` and `ai_run_score` become `agent_threads`,
  `agent_message`, `agent_tool_call`, `agent_working_memory`, `agent_run` and
  `agent_run_score`, along with their indexes and the `ai_working_memory_pk`
  constraint. The same rename applies to the MongoDB collections.

  `ensurePikkuSchema` creates tables it cannot find, so an existing database will
  get empty `agent_*` tables and leave the old data stranded in `ai_*`. Rename
  them before the first boot on the new version:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE ai_threads        RENAME TO agent_threads;
  ALTER TABLE ai_message        RENAME TO agent_message;
  ALTER TABLE ai_tool_call      RENAME TO agent_tool_call;
  ALTER TABLE ai_working_memory RENAME TO agent_working_memory;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run            RENAME TO agent_run;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run_score      RENAME TO agent_run_score;
  ```

- 6794681: Publish the ecosystem surface as per-area sub-barrels under `@pikku/core/ecosystem/*`, and point generated code, the CLI, the inspector and the runtime adapters at them.

  348 names that only generated code, the toolchain or a runtime adapter ever imports now have a second home on `@pikku/core/ecosystem/<area>` — one sub-barrel per area, matching how core already publishes its entrypoints, so no single barrel grows without bound and a consumer only pulls in the area it uses.

  This step is additive: every name is still exported from the entrypoint it was published from before, so nothing downstream breaks. Removing them from the app-facing barrels is a later change, and needs a release carrying `./ecosystem/*` first.

- 5e4105e: fix(ws): cap the frame size every Pikku-owned WebSocketServer accepts

  `ws` defaults `maxPayload` to 100MB, and every `WebSocketServer` Pikku
  constructed omitted the option — so each one inherited that ceiling. A single
  unauthenticated upgrade could make the process buffer a 100MB frame, which no
  Pikku message needs: the channel protocol carries JSON control frames, not bulk
  payloads.

  `@pikku/ws` now exports `DEFAULT_WS_MAX_PAYLOAD` (1MB), and the servers Pikku
  owns are constructed with it — the `pikku dev` / `pikku serve` runner, the entry
  `@pikku/deploy-standalone` emits, and the `ws` template. Refusal is already
  defined by the protocol, so an oversized frame is closed with 1009 (message too
  big) rather than buffered.

  A server that genuinely needs to accept a larger frame now has to set
  `maxPayload` explicitly at its construction site. `yarn check:ws-max-payload`
  enforces that, so a new server cannot silently fall back to the 100MB default.

## 0.12.10

### Patch Changes

- fd9d834: Stop publishing internals that only their own package or file used. The declarations stay; only the entrypoint re-export is removed, so nothing that imported a name from where it is declared is affected.

## 0.12.9

### Patch Changes

- e110c55: Add runtime scoring for AI agents: `pikkuAIScorer` for heuristic grades and
  `pikkuAIJudge` for LLM-judged ones, graded off the request path on two queue
  lanes so a slow judge cannot starve the cheap checks. Grades are sampled
  deterministically per `(run, scorer)` and persisted to `ai_run_score`.

## 0.12.8

### Patch Changes

- 637e668: State every package's license in the package itself.

  Eight publishable packages had no `license` field, `@pikku/aws-services` said `UNLICENSED` by accident, and no package carried a LICENSE file at all — the grant lived only in the repo root, which npm tarballs never include. Every publishable package now declares its license and ships the matching LICENSE file, and `yarn check:licenses` fails the release if the two ever disagree.

  `@pikku/console` is now explicitly BUSL-1.1 and named in the root LICENSE's Licensed Work alongside `@pikku/cli` and `@pikku/inspector`; the Additional Use Grant still permits production use for any purpose, including in free and open source software. Everything else — runtimes, services, clients, deploy adapters and the agent skills — is MIT, as the root LICENSE already said.

## 0.12.7

### Patch Changes

- 6f6abfe: Mount MCP on the bun runtime. `@pikku/bun-server` now accepts `mcpJson`/`mcpPath`
  options and serves the MCP endpoint (default `/mcp`) via a new fetch-native
  handler on `PikkuMCPServer.createFetchHandler()`, which uses the MCP SDK's
  Web-Standard (`Request`→`Response`) streamable-HTTP transport — no `node:http`
  req/res. The standalone `--runtime bun` entry now wires the same `mcpImport` +
  `mcpJson` option the node entry already used, so a bun standalone build serves
  `/mcp` with the project's tools/resources/prompts instead of silently dropping
  them. `@pikku/modelcontextprotocol` is an optional peer dep of `@pikku/bun-server`
  (only imported when `mcpJson` is non-empty).

## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 41ce2cb: Upgrade to TypeScript 6 and raise the minimum Node.js version to 22.

  All packages now build against `typescript@^6.0.3` and declare `engines.node >= 22`. Internal tooling (`ts-json-schema-generator`, `zod-to-ts`) was bumped to TypeScript 6-compatible releases.

## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 04604fa: Mount /mcp in generated server/standalone entries when the unit has a non-empty mcp.gen.json. Previously only the dev server (`tsx src/server.ts`) mounted MCP; the deployed bundle (`pikku deploy plan`) never imported mcp.gen.json or passed `mcpJson` to `PikkuNodeHTTPServer`, so MCP tools/resources/prompts silently never served in production or standalone runtimes.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- e443e94: feat(deploy): standalone provider can target the bun runtime

  `pikku deploy plan|apply --provider standalone --runtime bun` now generates a
  `@pikku/bun-server` entry (native `Bun.serve` WebSockets, no `ws` package) and
  compiles the bundle into a single self-contained executable via
  `bun build --compile` — no runtime needed on the target host. The default
  remains `--runtime node`, which is unchanged (ships `bundle.js`, run with
  `node bundle.js`).

  `PikkuBunServer` now accepts an injectable `eventHub` in its options. Inject the
  same `BunEventHubService` you pass to `createSingletonServices` so functions and
  the WebSocket transport share one hub — otherwise a function's
  `eventHub.publish(...)` targets a different hub than the one holding the live
  sockets and broadcasts never reach connected clients. The standalone bun entry
  and the `bun` template now wire this shared hub, fixing cross-connection /
  cross-transport channel pub-sub on bun.

  Also removes the unused `@yao-pkg/pkg` dependency and its stale type shim from
  `@pikku/deploy-standalone` (the pkg-based binary path was dropped in #489).

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- 9060165: Fix `@pikku/addon-graph` package exports so generated bootstrap files can be imported correctly. The Node.js HTTP server adapter is unified across dev, standalone, and container deployments. Next.js gains a worker-RPC transport. Date values in fetch responses now deserialise correctly.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 5c98fd1: Switch standalone deploy from uWebSockets.js to Express + ws
  - Replace PikkuUWSServer with PikkuExpressServer in generated entry
  - Add WebSocket support via ws + pikkuWebsocketHandler
  - Remove pkg binary compilation — ship bundle.js directly
  - Remove native module (uws .node) handling
  - Add loadSchemas: false to avoid global state resolution issues
  - Add getHttpServer() to PikkuExpressServer for ws attachment
