Replace config-based addon declarations with the new `wireAddon()` code-based API. Addons are now declared directly in wiring files using `wireAddon({ name, package, rpcEndpoint?, auth?, tags? })` instead of the `addons` field in `pikku.config.json`. The inspector reads these declarations from the TypeScript AST at build time.
