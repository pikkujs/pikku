## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 15c4968: The default runtime path no longer needs `node:*`, `Buffer` or an unguarded `process`, so it loads on edge runtimes (Web APIs only).

  **Breaking:** `FileScenarioRunStore`, `scenarioArtifactContentType` and `scenarioRunSummary` leave the `@pikku/core/services` barrel because they use `node:fs`. Import them from `@pikku/core/services/file-scenario-run-store`. Pre-0.13 breaking changes still ship as a patch.

  **Breaking:** the HMAC helpers in `@pikku/core/hmac` run on Web Crypto, which is async. `hmacSha256Hex`, `hmacDigest`, `verifyHmacSignature` and `verifyPublicKeySignature` now return a Promise; `timingSafeStringEqual` stays synchronous. `WebhookService.sign` and `WebhookService.verify` return a Promise, and so does `verifySlackSignature` in `@pikku/gateway-slack`: `await` them. A function-style `verify` on a webhook source may return a Promise as well. `verifyPublicKeySignature` accepts RSA and EC (P-256, P-384, P-521) PEM keys; Ed25519 and RSA-PSS keys verify as false.

  `isProduction()` (and the `PIKKU_MODEL_ALIASES` and `PIKKU_ENV` reads) now ask the registered singleton services' `variables` service first, then `process.env` when `process` exists. With neither, `isProduction()` is true, so an edge deployment never exposes error details by accident. `LocalVariablesService` resolves its `process.env` default when constructed and falls back to an empty store without `process`.

  Workflow invocation ids use a built-in SHA-1 and stay byte-identical. `@pikku/kysely` and the Cloudflare hibernation server use `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID()` and no `Buffer`; `@pikku/kysely` is marked `sideEffects: false`. `@pikku/ai-deepinfra` reads `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` only when `process` exists and decodes base64 audio without `Buffer`.

  Runtime tiers. A package declares where it can run in `package.json`: `"pikku": { "runtime": "edge" | "serverless" | "server" }`, with optional per-subpath overrides (`"exports": { "./dev": "server" }`). `server` is the default. `@pikku/core` and the default services are `edge` (core's Node-only subpaths are `server`), `@pikku/better-auth`, `@pikku/addon-admin` and `@pikku/cloudflare` are `serverless` (better-auth statically imports `node:crypto` scrypt), and `@pikku/addon-console` is `server` and must never land in a deployed unit.

  `pikku deploy` now verifies each deployed unit before bundling it. The unit is bundled with esbuild (neutral platform, `workerd`/`worker`/`browser` conditions) under its tier's profile, ahead of the adapter's aliases and stubs so they cannot hide anything, and the build fails when the bundle holds a package declared above the unit's tier or a Node built-in the runtime does not provide. The error names the unit, package, import chain and the fix. A built-in the provider stubs is a warning. On an edge unit, a bundled `InMemory*` class also fails the build. The unit's tier is its `runtime`, else the project's own `pikku.runtime`, else the provider default (`serverless` on Cloudflare). Packages that declare nothing are judged by their imports only.

  `ProviderAdapter.getRuntimeProfile(tier?)` returns the compat date, compat flags, the built-ins the runtime provides (keyed by compat date), the stubbed ones and the externals. The Cloudflare adapter derives `wrangler.toml`, the upload metadata and the bundle externals from it; `node:os` and `node:fs` are not provided before compat date 2025-09-15. The default is `nodejs_compat_v2` with compat date 2024-12-18, which is what `wrangler.toml` and Fabric's live workers already use, so Fabric deploys see no runtime change. Only the direct-API upload in `@pikku/deploy-cloudflare` (`createWorker`, used by its own `deploy()`) moves: it sent `nodejs_compat` with 2024-01-01 before. A newer date or flag is opt-in through the adapter option `new CloudflareProviderAdapter({ compatDate })` or `getCloudflareRuntimeProfile(tier, compatDate)`. From 2025-08-15 `node:http` and `node:https` exist, and from 2025-09-15 `node:os`, `node:fs` (stubbed by the build regardless) and `node:perf_hooks`; the verifier's allowed built-ins follow the effective date. A newer date changes the runtime of every worker deployed with it.

  `declareScopes(['pikku:console'])` (from `@pikku/core/scope`) declares scopes by id without wiring anything. `wireAddon({ scopes })` only requires a scope of an addon's functions; the tree arrives with the addon's metadata, so a role granting `pikku:console` used to fail PKU124 unless the addon was wired, and a wired `@pikku/addon-console` lands in every unit carrying the `/rpc` catch-all. An app that grants the scope without the console now calls `declareScopes` and no longer needs the scaffold or the addon. When the addon is wired its tree and descriptions win and the bare id adds nothing.

  More packages declare a tier after bundling each with the edge profile. `edge`: `@pikku/addon-graph`, `@pikku/pino`, `@pikku/jose`, `@pikku/ai-vercel`, `@pikku/ai-voice`. `serverless`: `@pikku/kysely-postgres` (postgres.js needs `node:buffer`, `stream`, `events`), `@pikku/backblaze` (`copyFile` reads a local file, which the build stubs), `@pikku/gateway-slack` (`@slack/web-api` imports `node:os` and `zlib`). `server`: `@pikku/schedule` (`cron` imports `child_process`), `@pikku/aws-services` (the AWS SDK's Node handler needs `node:http2`), `@pikku/browser` (puppeteer), and `@pikku/modelcontextprotocol` except its `./fetch` subpath, which is `edge`.

  `@pikku/addon-graph` no longer needs `node:crypto` or `Buffer`: the Crypto function hashes and HMACs on Web Crypto (MD5 is built in, since Web Crypto has none) and encodes with `TextEncoder`/`atob`/`btoa`, with output unchanged.

## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 4c7a1b5: Run the monorepo's own scripts through bun instead of yarn. What moves is the
  package manager each package's `prepublishOnly` and build scripts invoke, plus
  the two manifest fixes bun needs to resolve the tree: `uWebSockets.js` is
  declared with an explicit `github:` specifier, and `@pikku/uws-handler` marks
  its `uWebSockets.js` peer optional so a bun install of a consumer that brings
  its own uWS app does not try to fetch it from the registry.

  Three published behaviours change, all of them cases where an isolated
  `node_modules` or bun as the runtime had been papered over by yarn's hoisting:

  - `@pikku/migrator-sql` turns foreign keys on when it opens a sqlite database
    through bun. `node:sqlite` enforces them by default and `bun:sqlite` does not,
    which silently turned every `ON DELETE CASCADE` into a no-op under
    `bunx --bun pikku`.
  - `@pikku/cli` resolves a deploy provider against the project being deployed
    rather than against wherever the CLI itself is installed, which is what its
    own "is not installed" error asks the user to arrange.
  - `@pikku/cli` treats a specifier a runtime hands straight back — bun does this
    for the modules it implements itself — as not resolved from the project, so
    it falls back rather than loading the runtime's own copy.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- 7406bfe: Rename the agent runtime from `AI*` to `Agent*` (#596)

  `AI` described the model provider, not the thing being named. Every symbol that
  belongs to the agent runtime now says `Agent`; the symbols that genuinely wrap a
  model provider — `AIEmbeddingService`, `AIProviderOptions`, `AIEmbedParams`,
  `AITranscriptionParams`, `AIGenerateImageParams` and their siblings, and the
  `@pikku/ai-vercel` / `@pikku/ai-deepinfra` / `@pikku/ai-voice` packages — keep
  their names.

  **Wiring**
  - `pikkuAIAgent` → `pikkuAgent`, `pikkuAIScorer` → `pikkuAgentScorer`,
    `pikkuAIJudge` → `pikkuAgentJudge`
  - `CoreAIAgent` → `CoreAgent`, `AIAgentInput` → `AgentInput`, `AIAgentStep` →
    `AgentStep`, `AIMessage` → `AgentMessage`, and the rest of the agent types
  - `AIAgentRunnerService` → `AgentRunnerService`, `AIStorageService` →
    `AgentStorageService`, `AIRunStateService` → `AgentRunStateService`

  **Entry points**

  `@pikku/core/agent` → `@pikku/core/agent`, `@pikku/core/agent-scorer` →
  `@pikku/core/agent-scorer`.

  **Queues**

  The scorer queues are now `agent-score-fast` and `agent-score-slow`. Drain the
  old `ai-score-fast` / `ai-score-slow` queues before deploying — jobs still
  sitting on them when the new workers start will never be picked up.

  **Scaffolds**

  The agent scaffold pikku wrote for your project — `<scaffold>/agent/agent.gen.ts`
  and its schemas file — imports `@pikku/core/ai-agent`, which no longer exists. A
  scaffold is normally written once and then left alone, so `pikku all` would find
  it present and leave the broken import in place. It now deletes an agent scaffold
  importing either removed entry point and regenerates it in the same run. Anything
  you added to that file goes with it, so move local edits out first.

  **Database**

  The agent tables are renamed: `ai_threads`, `ai_message`, `ai_tool_call`,
  `ai_working_memory`, `ai_run` and `ai_run_score` become `agent_threads`,
  `agent_message`, `agent_tool_call`, `agent_working_memory`, `agent_run` and
  `agent_run_score`, along with their indexes and the `ai_working_memory_pk`
  constraint. The same rename applies to the MongoDB collections.

  `ensurePikkuSchema` creates tables it cannot find, so an existing database will
  get empty `agent_*` tables and leave the old data stranded in `ai_*`. Rename
  them before the first boot on the new version:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE ai_threads        RENAME TO agent_threads;
  ALTER TABLE ai_message        RENAME TO agent_message;
  ALTER TABLE ai_tool_call      RENAME TO agent_tool_call;
  ALTER TABLE ai_working_memory RENAME TO agent_working_memory;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run            RENAME TO agent_run;
  ALTER TABLE ai_run_score      RENAME TO agent_run_score;
  ```
