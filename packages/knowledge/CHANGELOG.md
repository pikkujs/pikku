### Patch Changes

- b89d3b3: Bring the knowledge base into OSS: a package, a CLI gate, a console browser and a skill

  `knowledge/` is where a project records the things `pikku meta` cannot tell you —
  what a slice is for, which rule was chosen and what it rules out, what is still an
  open question. Tables, routes, schemas and permissions are generated, so a note
  that repeats them is a copy that will drift, and the profile refuses the sections
  where that happens.
  - **`@pikku/knowledge`** (new) reads the notes, builds the link graph in both
    directions, and validates the app-project profile: every note typed, every
    section indexed, every slice carrying a third-person gherkin scenario and at
    most three entities, and every `resource:` URI resolving against the generated
    meta. The resource check fails closed on drift and open on ignorance — a prefix
    whose meta is absent is skipped rather than called dangling.
  - **`pikku knowledge validate`** and **`pikku knowledge index`** replace the dead
    three-flat-files check. Both exit non-zero on an inconsistent base, so a
    pipeline can stop on one; `index` refreshes each `index.md` listing while
    leaving the prose around it alone, and now gives a section that holds only
    sub-sections an index of its own instead of leaving it unreachable.
  - **The console** gains a read-only Knowledge page: notes grouped by section,
    a rendered document with its tags, resources, links in both directions and the
    findings against it, and intra-bundle markdown links that open the linked note
    instead of leaving the page. Read-only by design — a note is edited in the repo,
    in the same commit as the code it describes.
  - **The `pikku-knowledge` skill** documents the format for agents, and Fabric
    builds on it rather than restating it.
  - **`@pikku/inspector`**: a zod schema imported from a built workspace package
    resolved to that package's `.d.ts`, which has no runtime exports at all, so
    every schema in it was reported missing. The emitted JS beside it is imported
    instead.
