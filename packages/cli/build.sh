# We use the latest published version from npm to generate Pikku types because
# the CLI package needs its own generated types to build itself (bootstrap problem).
# This relies on the published version being backwards compatible enough to generate
# types that work with the current codebase.

# the generated files reflect the actual current state of the CLI.

# and the generated type files.
