## 0.12.8

### Patch Changes

- 6847338: Stop one slow job from holding an entire queue (head-of-line blocking).

  The worker mapped pikku's parallelism to pg-boss `batchSize`, whose handler
  receives the whole fetched batch and only fetches again once that handler
  resolves. Because the handler `Promise.all`s the batch, a single long-running
  job blocked every sibling in its batch _and_ stalled the next fetch — so on a
  shared queue one slow job could freeze the worker and starve everything behind
  it (observed with workflow-orchestrator jobs, where a long step pinned all 10
  slots for tens of minutes).

  Parallelism now maps to pg-boss `localConcurrency` with `batchSize: 1`: N
  independent workers each fetch and process a single job and refill the instant
  they finish, so a slow job never holds up the others. Same effective
  concurrency, no head-of-line blocking.

- e3d4454: Add job groups, so one shared queue can stay fair without splitting into one
  queue per producer.

  A job may now carry `group: { id, tier }`, and a worker may cap how many jobs
  of any one group run at once via `groupConcurrency`. On pg-boss this maps to
  `localGroupConcurrency`, which excludes at-capacity groups from the fetch query
  itself, so a capped group costs nothing rather than being fetched and restored.
  BullMQ declares it unsupported (groups are a BullMQ Pro feature) — being
  push-based, it can simply use a queue per group at no polling cost.

  Workflow services accept a `queueStrategy`. The default `'per-workflow'` is
  unchanged: every workflow gets its own `wf-orchestrator-*` / `wf-step-*` queue,
  which is also what lets serverless providers deploy one unit per workflow. The
  new `'shared-groups'` routes every workflow through the shared
  orchestrator/step-worker queues and isolates them by group instead, so a
  monolith runs one set of pollers rather than one per workflow — on a
  pull-based backend with dozens of workflows that is the difference between
  hundreds of poll loops and twenty. It is for single-process runtimes only; a
  per-unit serverless deploy still needs the per-workflow queues to route to its
  units.

## 0.12.7

### Patch Changes

- 6c30861: fix workflow step retry backoff firing immediately
  - `@pikku/queue-pg-boss`: `backoff: 'exponential'` mapped to `retryBackoff: true` without a base `retryDelay`; pg-boss computes exponential backoff as `retry_delay * 2^n` with a queue default of 0, so every retry fired immediately. Exponential backoff now gets a 1s base delay, and sub-second fixed delays round up to 1s instead of flooring to 0 (= immediate).
  - `@pikku/core`: a duration-string `retryDelay` (e.g. `'15s'`) on a workflow step was silently dropped (only numbers were honored) and fell back to exponential. It now resolves to a fixed backoff via `getDurationInMilliseconds`.

### Patch Changes

- 05aba57: fix(scheduler): prune orphaned recurring-task schedules on start

  When a scheduled task is removed from code, its pg-boss schedule row survived and
  kept producing jobs into a queue with no registered worker — the jobs piled up as
  'created' forever and could flood the queue (thousands of stuck jobs). `start()`
  now drops any `pikku-recurring-scheduled-task_*` schedule and queue that is no
  longer registered, so task removals self-heal on the next boot.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- 92cd5b1: feat(workflow): workflow-owned step retries + stable invocationId

  The workflow — not the queue — now owns step retry policy, and each step
  invocation gets a stable idempotency key.
  - **Default `retries: 5` with exponential backoff.** A step with no `retries`
    previously inherited the queue's bare default (e.g. pg-boss `retry_limit 2`,
    no backoff) so retries fired instantly and couldn't outlast a transient
    outage. Retries now default to 5 with backoff, resolved at the workflow layer.
  - **`retries: 0` is honored.** Dispatch previously passed `undefined` options
    for `retries: 0`, letting the queue re-run a non-idempotent step up to its own
    default. The resolved policy now always sets `attempts` (`retries: 0` →
    `attempts: 1`), so the queue never second-guesses the workflow. The persisted
    step retries and the dispatched `attempts` are resolved together so
    "retries exhausted" and "no more redeliveries" are the same event.
  - **`workflowStep.invocationId`** — a deterministic, dependency-free
    `uuidv5(runId:stepName)` handed to every step. Unlike `stepId` (minted per
    attempt), it is identical across retries, so a step can dedupe on it
    (`ON CONFLICT (invocationId)`, Stripe idempotency keys, etc.).
  - **queue-bullmq**: `mapPikkuJobToBull` now maps `backoff` (previously dropped,
    so a step's backoff silently never applied on Redis), and `registerQueues`
    throws a clear error when no logger is available (matching queue-pg-boss).
  - **Dispatch failures are recoverable, not fatal.** A step is now marked
    `scheduled` only _after_ it is successfully handed to its transport (queue or
    scheduler) — a failed hand-off leaves it `pending` so a replay re-dispatches
    it, instead of stranding it in `scheduled` (replay would pause forever on a
    job that was never enqueued). A transport outage (e.g. pg-boss momentarily
    down) is surfaced as a new `WorkflowDispatchException`, which the orchestrator
    treats as transient: the run is left running and the orchestrator job is
    rethrown for redelivery (it replays idempotently from the snapshot) rather
    than the whole run being marked `failed`. The orchestrator job now also
    carries its own retry policy, so this holds even when the orchestrator queue
    is configured `retry_limit 0`. A genuine step error still fails the run.
  - **Same step name can be invoked multiple times in one run.** Step rows are now
    keyed per _invocation_: the Nth reach of a step name in a replay resolves to a
    physical key (`name` for the first, `name#N` for repeats), so a literal
    duplicate name no longer clobbers the earlier step's state. The first reach
    keeps the bare name, so existing rows, graph-node matching and `invocationId`s
    are unchanged. Ordinals are derived deterministically from DSL execution order
    and reset each replay.
  - **Step provenance (`fromStepName`) + graph cycles.** Every step now records
    the predecessor it was scheduled from (`fromStepName`; entry steps have none),
    persisted on the step row across all stores (in-memory, kysely, redis,
    mongodb, cloudflare DO) and carried in the queued payload. The DSL wire
    exposes the derived `fromInvocationId` (`uuidv5(runId:fromStepName)`) so
    consumers get the stable predecessor key without a second persisted id —
    `fromStepName` is the source of truth (it is replay-deterministic; `stepId`,
    minted per row, is not). This makes the walked path reconstructable even when
    a node is reached more than once: in `a → b → a → c` the second `a` is a
    distinct ordinal instance (`a#1`) whose `fromStepName` is `b`.
    The graph runner now supports **cycles**: a forward edge into an
    already-started node still collapses to a single run (joins/diamonds are
    unchanged), but a _back-edge_ — one whose target can reach its source — fires
    a fresh ordinal instance, so a node can loop back to itself. Termination is
    the graph's responsibility (branch routing must converge); the engine enforces
    no visit cap.

### Patch Changes

- 8b9b2e9: Accept optional logger parameter in `registerQueues()` instead of reaching into pikku state directly. Falls back to `getSingletonServices()` for backwards compatibility.
- 8b9b2e9: Fix child workflow completion in queued execution mode. When a sub-workflow completes, the parent step is now marked as succeeded and the parent orchestrator resumes automatically via `onChildWorkflowCompleted`. Adds `parentStepId` to `WorkflowRunWire` to track the parent step without querying. Retains advisory locks in PgKyselyWorkflowService for concurrency safety. Fixes pgboss `registerQueues` to accept an optional logger parameter.
