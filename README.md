# Vramework

## A minimal framework for building HTTP servers in Node.js

- Write code agnostic to which server or protocol is running.
- Throw an error in your code and it's mapped to the correct HTTP status code.
- Validate all your input directly via schemas generated from your function types.
- Attach permissions logic to and/or different scenarios.
- Deploy via serverless, express or even within nextJS (coming soon).
