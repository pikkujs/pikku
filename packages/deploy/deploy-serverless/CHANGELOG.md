# @pikku/deploy-serverless

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 637e668: State every package's license in the package itself.

  Eight publishable packages had no `license` field, `@pikku/aws-services` said `UNLICENSED` by accident, and no package carried a LICENSE file at all — the grant lived only in the repo root, which npm tarballs never include. Every publishable package now declares its license and ships the matching LICENSE file, and `yarn check:licenses` fails the release if the two ever disagree.

  `@pikku/console` is now explicitly BUSL-1.1 and named in the root LICENSE's Licensed Work alongside `@pikku/cli` and `@pikku/inspector`; the Additional Use Grant still permits production use for any purpose, including in free and open source software. Everything else — runtimes, services, clients, deploy adapters and the agent skills — is MIT, as the root LICENSE already said.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 41ce2cb: Upgrade to TypeScript 6 and raise the minimum Node.js version to 22.

  All packages now build against `typescript@^6.0.3` and declare `engines.node >= 22`. Internal tooling (`ts-json-schema-generator`, `zod-to-ts`) was bumped to TypeScript 6-compatible releases.
