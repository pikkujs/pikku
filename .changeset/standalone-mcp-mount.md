Mount /mcp in generated server/standalone entries when the unit has a non-empty mcp.gen.json. Previously only the dev server (`tsx src/server.ts`) mounted MCP; the deployed bundle (`pikku deploy plan`) never imported mcp.gen.json or passed `mcpJson` to `PikkuNodeHTTPServer`, so MCP tools/resources/prompts silently never served in production or standalone runtimes.
